          <p>
            The <strong>Flemish Giant rabbit</strong> (Dutch:
            <em>Vlaamse reus</em>) is the largest breed of domestic rabbit (<em
              >Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus</em
            >). Flemish Giants are historically a utility breed used for their
            fur and meat. They are often kept as pets as they are known for
            being docile and patient when being handled.
          </p>

        <section id="history">
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The Flemish Giant originated in Flanders. It was bred as early as
            the 16th century near the city of Ghent, Belgium. It is believed to
            have descended from a number of meat and fur breeds, possibly
            including the Steenkonijn ("Stone Rabbit" — referring to the old
            Belgian weight size of one stone or about 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb))
            and the European "Patagonian" breed (now extinct). This "Patagonian"
            rabbit, a large breed that was once bred in Belgium and France, was
            not the same as the Patagonian rabbit of Argentina (Sylvilagus
            brasiliensis), a wild species of a different genus weighing less
            than 0.9 kilograms (2.0 lb), nor the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis
            patagonum), sometimes called the Patagonian hare, a species in the
            cavy family of rodents that cannot interbreed with rabbits. Thomas
            Coatoam, in his Origins of the Flemish Giants, states that "The
            earliest authentic record of the Flemish Giant Rabbit occurred about
            the year 1860, in which the veterinarian and ex-biologist, Oscar
            Nisbett, selectively bred a series of generations of Patagonian
            rabbit."
          </p>
          <p>
            The first standards for the breed were written in 1893. The Flemish
            Giant is an ancestor of many rabbit breeds from all over the world,
            one of which is the Belgian Hare, which was imported into England in
            the mid-19th century. The Flemish Giant was exported from England
            and Belgium to America in the early 1890s to increase the size of
            meat rabbits during the great "rabbit boom".
          </p>
          <p>
            The breed received little attention until about 1910, when it
            started appearing at small livestock shows throughout the country.
            Today, it is one of the more popular breeds at rabbit shows due to
            its unusually large size and varying colors. It is promoted by the
            National Federation of Flemish Giant Rabbit Breeders, which was
            formed in 1915. The Flemish Giant has many nicknames, including the
            "Gentle Giant" for its uniquely docile personality, and the
            "universal rabbit" for its varied purposes as a pet, show, breeding,
            meat, and fur animal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flemish giants are also popular as pets, especially in Europe and
            North America. Although they are large, they are known to exhibit
            cleanliness and can be trained to use a litter box.

          <h2>Appearance</h2>
          <p>
            As one of the largest breeds of domestic rabbit, the Flemish Giant
            is a semi-arch type rabbit with its back arch starting behind the
            shoulders and carrying through to the base of the tail, giving a
            "mandolin" shape. The body of a Flemish Giant Rabbit is long and
            powerful, with relatively broad hindquarters. The fur of the Flemish
            Giant is glossy and dense. When stroked from the hindquarters to the
            head, the fur will roll back to its original position.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bucks have a broad, massive head in comparison to does, and can take
            1.5 years to reach full maturity. Does may have a large, full,
            evenly carried dewlap (the fold of skin under their chins), and can
            take 1 year to reach full maturity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flemish Giant rabbits weigh 6.8 kilograms (15 lb) on average, though
            the largest ones can weigh up to 22 kilograms (49 lb). The longest
            one on record (which holds the record for the longest rabbit in the
            world of any kind), measured about 1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in) long.
          </p>
          <p>
            The American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) standard recognizes
            seven different colors for the breed: black, blue, fawn, sandy,
            light gray, steel gray, and white. The show standard minimum weight
            for a senior doe is 6.4 kilograms (14 lb), and the show standard
            minimum weight of a senior buck is 5.9 kilograms (13 lb). The
            world's largest rabbit is Darius, a Flemish Giant rabbit that weighs
            49 lb (22 kg) and measures 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in).

          <h2>Behavior and Lifestyle</h2>
          <p>
            Flemish Giants can be docile and tolerant of being handled if they
            frequently have interactions with humans.

          <p>
            The gestation period is between 28 and 31 days. On average, they
            give birth at 30–32 days. The Flemish Giant rabbit can produce large
            litters, usually between 5 and 12 in a litter.
          </p>
          <h3 id="4h-and-show">4H and Show</h3>
          <p>
            Flemish Giants, due to their uncomplicated grooming requirements and
            docile personalities, are used by 4-H programs throughout the United
            States as a starter rabbit for teaching children responsibility and
            care of farm animals and pets. Another popular youth program outside
            4-H that promotes responsible show breeding is the National
            Federation of Flemish Giant Breeders Youth Program. Flemish Giants
            are the second-oldest domesticated rabbit breed in the United
            States, following behind the now rare Belgian Hare.
